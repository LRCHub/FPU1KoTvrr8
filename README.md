# ONE OK ROCK – 20/20

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Back then always thought that you had my back
You were just there to stab it
Hindsights 20/20 should've seen it then
Maybe I should get glasses
Screw me over like you didn't know my name
Oh I was so convenient
I don't know why you wanna play me like a game
True colors show
Now I can see
Exactly who you are pretending
We used to be alright don't lie
'cause now I can see
That you were never honest with me
I will never let you back into my life
さっきまでここにいたはずのあなたはどこへ?
一切見返りを求めないなんて嘘ならべ
何かが壊れる音がしてもなお絶妙なバランスで
首の皮一枚つながった お前さ
Now I can see
Exactly who you are pretending
We used to be alright don't lie
'cause now I can see
That you were never honest with me
I will never let you back into my life
Now I can see
Exactly who you are pretending
We used to be alright
Now I can see
Exactly who you are pretending
We used to be alright don't lie
'cause now I can see
That you were never honest with me
I will never let you back into my life
